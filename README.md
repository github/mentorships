This year [​the program was trimmed back](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-March/008358.html) and room was needed for new organizations.

> So we decided to launch our first **Tor Summer of Privacy!** This is a pilot program we hope will grow and guarantee support for students who want to collaborate with privacy tools.

### [The X.Org Endless Vacation of Code](https://www.x.org/wiki/XorgEVoC/)

> The basic terms and conditions of this program are quite similar to Google's GSoC. The key differences are that:
>
> 1. an EVoC mentorship can be initiated at any time during the calendar year,
> 2. the Board can fund as many of these mentorships as it sees fit.

- **Audience:** Everyone. They will also consider a broader range of proposals than GSoC: technical documentation is a specific area of interest for them.
- **Stipend:** $5000 for students over 18
