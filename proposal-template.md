# Application Proposal template

1. Who are you? We need your name, and how to contact you! (email, etc.)

2. What do you want to do? Make us interested in your idea - why is your idea awesome?

3. How are you going to do it? Tell us how you are going to accomplish your proposal, including a detailed work timeline that breaks the project into one or two week milestones. Convince us that you’ve thought this through, and have an idea of how to proceed.

4. Why you? Link to any examples of past work, such as patches to OSS projects, GitHub (or other code hosting sites) repositories, etc, so we can better evaluate your skills.

GitHub is actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome applications from women from all backgrounds and people of color.
